22. The authors closely associate the Lisp language with the lambda calculus.

23. For example, in a 16-bit computer, the number 55 is an abstraction of the
    16-bit number 0000000000110111.

24. An abstract data type is a set of data values and the real operations on
    those values that are hidden from the users. We want this because we want
    the users to use some of the features of our program without changing the
    contents in those features.
    In java, it is like to define a class that has some public functions and
    also some private data and functions.

25. Syntactic sugar is a mechanism that allows users to replace a complex
    notation with a simpler and shorter notion. One example of syntactic sugar
    I know of is the short hand i++, which stands for i = i + 1. This becomes
    really handy when used in a loop in java.

26. The function map is very much similar to the mathematical definition of
    a map, which applies certain function to a list of items and return a list
    of the resulting answers. Therefore, for each item in the first list, there
    is a map to a certain item in the second list.

27. In java, for an for loop, if we write:
       for (int i = 1, i < 3, i++)
    there would be a syntax error. We are supposed to put semicolon between
    statements, but instead we have coma.

28. An interpreter is a translator that can execute a program directly, while
    a compiler is a translator that would produce a suitable form for
    execution.
